# Backlog: Other Documents to Check

## NO ACTION NEEDED

RFC 1603 - IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures

Obsoleted by RFC 2418

RFC 2026 - The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3

Commentary: Mentions IETF Executive Director in Section 10. Needs to change to Managing Director, IETF Secretariat. BUT RFC 2026 Section 10 is Intellectual Property Rights, and that part of RFC 2026 is updated by RFC 8179 - Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology. RFC 8179 corrects mentions of the IETF Executive Director to the IETF Secretariat. As a result, no revision of either RFC 2026 or RFC 8179 is necessary. 


RFC 2027 - IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees

Obsoleted by RFC 2282


RFC 2282 - IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees

Obsoleted by RFC 2727


RFC 2727 - IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees

Obsoleted by RFC 3777


RFC 3777 - IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees

Obsoleted by RFC 7437 (which is on the list to revise)


RFC 3668 - Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology

Obsoleted by RFC 3979


RFC 3979 - Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology

Obsoleted by RFC 8179


RFC 8179 - Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology

Commentary: Predecessor documents, such as RFC 3979, mentions the IETF Executive Director. RFC 8179 corrects mentions of the IETF Executive Director to the IETF Secretariat. As a result, no revision of either RFC 8179 is necessary. 


RFC 3716 - The IETF in the Large:  Administration and Execution

Commentary: While this describes the administrative structure of the IETF, it dates to 2004 and is informational. As a result, no update is necessary.

Action: Filed erratum on 10/15/2018


RFC 3929 - Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-Blocked Decisions in the IETF

Commentary: While this touches on aspects of the administration of the IETF, such as mentioning the IETF Executive Director, it dates to 2004 and is experimental. As a result, no update is necessary.

Action: Filed erratum on 10/15/2018


RFC 4879 - Clarification of the Third Party Disclosure Procedure in RFC 3979

Obsoleted by RFC 8179


RFC 5633 - Nominating Committee Process: Earlier Announcement of Open Positions and Solicitation of Volunteers

Commentary: Obsoleted by RFC 7437 (being updated by the WG)

RFC 4633 - Experiment in Long-Term Suspensions From Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Mailing Lists

Commentary: Refers to IETF Executive Director. BUT, it describes a 2006 experiment that ran for 18 months and is filed as experimental. As a result, no obvious need to update it at this time.

## ACTION NEEDED
RFC 8318 - IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees

Issue: Mentions the IAOC extensively. We are already updating RFC 7437. Need to determine correct RFCs to have that -bis draft replace/obsolete.

General issues:
- Remove mention of IAOC, change to IETF LLC
- IETF Executive Director title or Managing Director, IETF Secretariat corrections
